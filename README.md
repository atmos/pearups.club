Pearups.club
============

Welcome to the OSS pearups.club app.

Main Purpose of this site:
 - Connect willing mentors with willing students to pair
 - Create a friendly ecosystem that encourages remote learning
 - Form as a launching pad for weekly or bi-weekly group hangouts and pairing sessions
 - Have a damn good time

What's currently included:
 - 3 controllers (welcome, mentor, and student)
 - The Mentor and Student models have the following parameters:
   - Name
   - Email
   - Skills (Have/Wanted)
   - Twitter
 - Basic CRUD interface to manipulate models

What would be cool:
 - Some damn CSS! :godmode: :8ball: :crystal_ball:
 - Full Profile Editing for mentors and students (Pictures, etc)
 - Some form of user creation / authentication (Have no idea how to do this)
 - Rating system for mentors + students to rate each other
 - Some calendar thing-y to schedule group pear-ops for general help and computer hating

This app is **extremely basic** in the current state.

**Any Help Would be Greatly Appreciated**

Currently, the app is an extremely simple CRUD app running Rails 4.2.0

Please observe the usual fork, clone, pr workflow.

To run:
 - Get a javascript runtime (https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs) - I'm just using nodejs
 - `bundle install`
 - `bundle exec rails server`
 - Open [browser](http://127.0.0.1:3000/) to observe how simple and basic it is.
